Over the past decade, the predominant trend was the age of big data. Emerging data sources like online clickstreams necessitated the introduction of various new hardware solutions, both on-premises and in cloud environments. These solutions primarily revolved around distributed computing, which involves distributing analytical calculations across multiple standard servers, or specialized data appliances.

<br>
In addition to advancements in hardware, the necessity to store and process large datasets in innovative ways gave rise to a wide array of open-source software solutions, including Hadoop and various scripting languages. Hadoop, for instance, serves as a platform for storing and conducting basic processing of extensive datasets, often proving to be significantly more cost-effective, often by a factor of ten, compared to traditional data warehouses when handling similar data volumes. Nowadays, numerous organizations are implementing Hadoop-based data lakes to retain various data types in their original formats until the need arises to structure and analyse them.

<br>
Given that a substantial portion of big data lacks inherent structure, data scientists have devised methods to organize it for statistical analysis. This is accomplished using both new and established scripting languages like Pig, Hive, and Python. Furthermore, specialized open-source tools such as Spark for streaming data and R for statistical analysis have also garnered considerable popularity. The process of adopting and utilizing open-source software represents a substantial shift, particularly for well-established businesses (_How Analytics Has Changed in the Last 10 Years (and How It’s Stayed the Same)_, 2017).

## Problem Solving with Business Analytics

Problem-solving using business analytics involves a structured process starting with problem recognition, precise problem definition, and structural breakdown. Data analysis is central, utilizing various techniques to interpret results and make informed decisions. The final step is implementing solutions based on insights gained.

This systematic approach enables organizations to address challenges and seize opportunities by leveraging data-driven insights effectively (Cordes, 2014).

<br>
1\. **Recognizing a Problem:** The first step in problem-solving using business analytics is recognizing that a problem or opportunity exists. This often involves identifying a specific challenge or a potential improvement in your organization's operations or strategies. For instance, a retail company might notice a decline in online sales despite increased website traffic, indicating a problem with conversion rates.

<br>
2\. **Defining the Problem:** Once the problem is recognized, it needs to be precisely defined. This means clarifying the problem's scope, objectives, and the desired outcomes. Continuing with the retail example, the company might define the problem as "low online conversion rates leading to decreased revenue."

<br>
3\. **Structuring the Problem:** Structuring the problem involves breaking it down into manageable components and understanding the relationships between them. It often involves identifying relevant data sources and metrics that can provide insights into the problem. In the retail scenario, structuring the problem might involve looking at website traffic data, customer demographics, and purchase patterns.

<br>
4\. **Analysing the Problem:** With a structured problem, you can start collecting and analysing data to gain insights. This step may involve using various analytical techniques such as statistical analysis, data mining, or machine learning. In our retail example, you might use customer behaviour data to identify patterns or correlations that shed light on why conversion rates are low.

<br>
5\. **Interpreting Results and Making a Decision**: Once the analysis is complete, it's time to interpret the results. This means understanding what the data is telling you and how it relates to the defined problem. Based on these insights, you can make informed decisions. In the retail case, you might discover that certain customer segments have a higher conversion rate, leading to a decision to target marketing efforts specifically at those segments.

<br>
6\. **Implementing the Solution:** Implementing the solution involves taking concrete actions based on your decisions. This could include making changes to processes, launching new marketing campaigns, or adjusting product offerings. In the retail example, implementing the solution might involve redesigning the website to improve user experience for the identified customer segments.

To summarize, problem-solving using business analytics is a structured process that starts with recognizing a problem, defining it clearly, breaking it down into manageable components, analysing relevant data, interpreting the results, making informed decisions, and finally, implementing solutions to address the problem or capitalize on opportunities. This systematic approach empowers organizations to leverage data-driven insights for more effective decision-making and improved business outcomes.

## 3 Successful Data Driven Decision Making Using Data Analytics

Now that we have developed a more understanding of the concept of making decisions based on data and their significance, we will explore five motivating instances of data-driven decision-making.

### Google

One of the most remarkable instances of data-driven decision-making is exemplified by Google. The company was intrigued by the question of whether the presence of managers had a genuine impact.

<br>
To address this inquiry, Google's data scientists examined performance reviews and employee surveys from the subordinates of managers (qualitative data). They visualized this data on a graph and concluded that, managers were generally viewed positively. Google then took it a step further by segmenting the data into the top and bottom quartiles and conducting regression analyses. These analyses revealed substantial differences between the most effective and least effective managers in terms of team productivity, employee satisfaction, and employee retention. Essentially, proficient managers not only contribute to Google's financial success but also foster a more content workforce. The question that remains is, what qualities define a proficient manager at Google?

### Walmart

Walmart employed a similar approach in preparing emergency supplies for Hurricane Frances in 2004, as reported by The New York Times. Company executives sought insights into the specific merchandise they should stock before the hurricane hit. Their analysts delved into historical purchase records from other Walmart stores that had faced similar circumstances, sifting through a vast terabyte of customer data to determine which products to dispatch to Florida (quantitative data). Surprisingly, it was discovered that during natural disasters, Americans turned to strawberry Pop-Tarts and beer. Linda M. Dillon, who served as Walmart's Chief Information Officer at the time, elucidated this process, stating, "By forecasting what would occur, rather than waiting for it to happen... trucks loaded with toaster pastries and six-packs were swiftly dispatched down Interstate 95 toward Walmart stores in the path of Hurricane Frances." In doing so, Walmart not only ensured that Floridians had an ample supply of beer and Pop-Tarts during the storm but also generated profits by accurately anticipating the surge in demand, resulting in rapid product sales.

### Netflix

Boasting more than 128 million active users, Netflix has established itself as the dominant force in the streaming service sector, owing much of its success to its adept utilization of data for customer retention. As the industry grows increasingly competitive, the company recognized the need to elevate the user experience and foster customer loyalty.

<br>
To achieve this, Netflix embarked on a comprehensive examination of various metrics related to customer behaviours and interactions. These metrics encompassed factors such as viewing duration, time of engagement, geographical location, preferred content genres, and even user actions like pausing and resuming content. Armed with this invaluable data, they meticulously crafted a highly precise recommendation algorithm aimed at enhancing the viewer's content consumption experience.

<br>
Following the implementation of this algorithm, Netflix conducted a thorough analysis of the outcomes and observed that nearly 80% of users were following the recommendations. This marked a resounding success in their quest to bolster customer retention rates and maintain their competitive edge. It serves as an exemplary instance of effective data-driven decision-making (source: The Advantages of Data-Driven Decision-Making | HBS Online, 2019).
