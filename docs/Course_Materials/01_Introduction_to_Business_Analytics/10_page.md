## The Basic of Business Analytics

Business analytics is a field that utilizes a variety of techniques and tools to convert unprocessed data into valuable insights for businesses. This data can come from diverse sources, including standard spreadsheets and conventional databases, along with social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. To achieve these insights, a spectrum of methods like statistical models and machine learning is employed. The primary objective of business analytics is to derive significant conclusions that aid in well-informed choices and play a role in an organization's achievements.

Data (Business) Analytics refers to the systematic computational analysis of data. It is the process of examining data sets to draw conclusions about the information they contain, increasingly with the aid of specialized systems and software. These tools and techniques help managers and business leaders gain improved insight into their business operations and make better, fact-based decisions from data.

Each day, employees, supply chains, marketing endeavours, finance teams, and various other aspects of every business contribute to this wealth of data. Big data encompasses vast volumes of data originating from diverse sources and taking various forms. Many organizations have come to realize the benefits of amassing extensive data stores. However, the mere collection and storage of big data are insufficient; it's imperative to harness its potential. Thanks to the rapid advancement of technology, organizations can utilize business analytics to convert terabytes of data into actionable insights (_Big Data Analytics: What It Is, How It Works, Benefits, and Challenges, 2023_).

## Growth in Big Data and Business Analytics

By the year 2025, experts anticipate that the amount of data we generate worldwide will skyrocket to a staggering 175 zettabytes. To give you a better grasp of the sheer magnitude, picture a towering stack of Blu-ray discs so tall that it could stretch all the way to the moon not just once, but an astonishing 23 times over! In simpler terms, we're churning out an enormous amount of data, and it's important to realize that this is just the start of our data-driven journey _(Data: A Small Four-Letter Word Which Has Grown Exponentially to Such a Big Value, 2021)_.

### Growth in Big Data

Big Data refers to the vast volumes of data generated by various sources, such as social media, sensors, transactions, and more. The growth of big data has been exponential, driven by advancements in technology and the increasing digitization of society. 

1. **Volume**: The sheer amount of data being generated is staggering. For example, every minute, millions of tweets are posted, and billions of emails are sent. This continuous data generation creates opportunities for analysis but also challenges in storage and processing.
      - **Example**: Facebook generates over 4 petabytes of data per day from user interactions, posts, and messages.

2. **Variety**: Data comes in various formats, including structured (databases), semi-structured (XML, JSON), and unstructured (text, images, videos).
      - **Example**: An e-commerce platform collects structured data from sales transactions, semi-structured data from customer reviews, and unstructured data from social media mentions.

3. **Velocity**: The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed. Real-time data processing is essential for applications like stock trading and fraud detection.
      - **Example**: Credit card companies analyze transaction data in real-time to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

4. **Veracity**: The uncertainty and quality of data. Ensuring data accuracy and reliability is crucial for making valid insights
      - **Example**: Social media sentiment analysis requires filtering out noise and irrelevant data to accurately gauge public opinion.

5. **Value**: The ultimate goal is to derive value from the data. This involves converting raw data into actionable insights
      - **Example**: Retailers use data analytics to optimize inventory levels, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction.
